## Layer 3, Head 10

In layer 3 head 10, BERT seems to have learned the basics of the grammar, getting higher weights in the correct next word. 

Example Sentences:
- We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small [MASK].
- Then I picked up a [MASK] from the table.

## Layer 8, Head 3

In layer 8 head 3, BERT seems to be getting some knowledge of the grammar, even though there's some notable weights in the correct values for the next word, there's still a bigger weight in the end of frase for every word, so that here BERT seems to be ending the word with no purpose.

Example Sentences:
- We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small [MASK].
- Then I picked up a [MASK] from the table.
